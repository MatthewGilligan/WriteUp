# Week 3 challenge: super_Memory
## Matthew Gilligan

## Recap
This week was unfortunately the first week where I didn't find the flag within the time constraints and lost half credit on the second assignment. That being said, it was still a super fun challenge that was very creative. Week 3 and still going strong! This week started with us hearing that we were going to be reading in C, so I was excited, as C++ is my main language. Additionally, we were told that big numbers use 4 bytes of data. We had an example where we learned about what hexadecimal was, and how it used a base 16 counting system using "123456789abcdef". The first digit would be multiplied by 1, the second would be multiplied by 256, the third by 256^2 and the final by 256^3. This makes it so that each when combined will equal the original large number. All of these bytes are prefixed by 0x such as 0xa =10 or 0xc =12. 

After this, we went breifly over arrays and structs, and focused on how they can overflow. Arrays can hold more than 1 variable at a time and are defined by the square brackets. For example: int myArray[2] holds two values, however when we try to call value "2" from the array it overflows because it starts counting from 0, meaning that the array is made up of myArray[0] and myArray[1]. 

Arrays aren't the only thing that can overflow. Numbers can also overflow. A number that keeps adding to itself will eventually "wrap around" into the opposite direction (ex: 1,2,...126,127,-128,-127,-126...). 

## Overview
This week I installed Visual Studio terminal, as apparently it's better than Powershell. After ssh'ing into the terminal, we were greeted by a video game where you controlled a character (literally a char, the letter p) and moved it around using w,a,s,d. We were told that everything we needed to get the flag was located inside the game itself. This is a form of offensive security called "exploitation" and is very common among video game testers. It can also be applied on a broader scale to detect vulnerabilities in websites. 

## Challenge of the week 
We had two levels this week. For the first level, it was much more of a platformer, where our player could double-jump and stand on characters in the environment. While it took a little bit of time to get used to the controls, physics and feel of the game, eventually I was able to climb through a long platforming section and find a construction that looked like a blank flag. Upon reaching the base of this flag, we were met with the text ""Does this feel like the end? Should Magellan have been proud of himself had he turned around after leaving the harbor? Answer: NO" This was clearly not the flag, but to the right (at the edge of the level) was another flag with a skull and crossbones on it. That seemed to be the flag that we needed in order to pass, however it was blocked off by a wall. I applied the concept of overloading, and instead of going to the right towards the flag, I went to the left, jumping off of a "cloud" in order to send my player's position into the negatives. This overloaded the player's x position, sending me all the way to the end of the level and finding the first flag. 

The second level was much harder for me to figure out this week, and I actually ended up only getting half points due to how slow I solved it. For the second level we were greeted with a text object that told us that Capital letters are doors, requiring us to pick up lowercase "keys" to go through them. When we hit "s" on a lowercase letter, it appeared in our "inventory", which consisted of 4 boxes. Additionally, there were 5 "$" symbols across the map that each incremented our $ count by 1 After going through all of the gates, I once again found a flag, however it was locked behind a gate that said "You need $1650549605 to unlock me". I noticed that the flag was once again positioned on the right side of the level, so after resetting I once again tried to go the left and overload the x position, however this didn't work as this player character was unable to jump on the "cloud" that took them to the negative x positons. 
After some experimenting, I realized that when you hit "s" on the lowercase letters enough, it begins to overload the dollar amount and cause it to skyrocket. After some experimenting, we found out that the "a" value was 97, "b" was 98, "c" was 99 and "d" was 100. We also looked up the ascii tables, where a correlated with 63, b with 64, c with 65 and d with 66. This table was generated by chatGPT, and I now belive it to not be fully correct. After talking with my team, we realized that we needed the exact $1650549605 amount, as when we went over, it said "Your excessive wealth disgusts me" and remained locked. We looked in the source code and found the exact code snippet: 
char* paid_unlock(char key, struct PlayerInfo *player_info) {
    if (blocks[key].solid == 1) {
        if (player_info->dollars == 1650549605) {
            player_info->dollars = 0;
            blocks[key].solid = 0;
            return "Unlocked!"; 
This meant that we needed to reverse engineer the number 1650549605. We were still using the buggy chatGPT ascii table, so it took us much longer than it should have to find the relating values. We ended up solving it using desmos by making an equation equal to "() + 256() + 256^2 () + 256^3 ()" and filling in the parentheses with the values. This was very much a brute force solve, but we still solved it, eventually finding the combination d,c,a,b. This combination actually resulted in 1 less than the value of 1650549605, but we very quickly realized that we could skip over one $ symbol and come back for it afterward. This allowed us to get to the required number and reach the flag. 
## Reflection
This week was very challenging, but also super fun! I think that if I were to solve it without using the brute force method (say for example we had 26 possible letters as opposed to only 4) I would take apart the large number and separate it into it's 4 byte form. From that point I would find the letter with the corresponding ascii value and enter it in reverse order so to fully assemble the number. While brute force is effective and can even be more time effecient when given a small size, it should not be relied on as the only was to solve cybersecurity problems. Overall, this week definitely made me think a lot and helped me grow in my cybersecurity skills.
