# Week 6
## Matthew Gilligan

## Recap
This week we learned about Git, and how to use it to navigate through files, undo, load previous states, create repos/branches, and see all changes made to a directory or repository. 

We began by talking about how linux/ unix systems are very good at deleting and creating things, and there is no undoing them. They will even allow you to brick your computer if you want to and know how to. We then talked about how about how Git is complimentary to these systems, as it can be used to save progress and create "branches" of a project that each do different things.
