# Week 5
## Matthew Gilligan

## Recap

This week was really fun, as we got to do reverse engineering. This was exciting for me, as reverse engineering was another area of the Deadface event where I got stuck and didn't have any idea how to solve it. 
## Overview
For this challenge, we needed to use Ghidra, which is a revsere engineering software made by the NSA.
