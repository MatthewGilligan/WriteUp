# Week 8
## Matthew Gilligan

## Recap
This week we had a "pwn" challenge, where we needed to hack into a webserver and accomplish various challenges, like exploiting, getting admin credentials, and over flowing the website. This was the final challenge of the fall term, and we definitely ended on a good one.

We started out this week by talking about what a webserver really was, and how it serves files (often HTML files) over servers (often HTTP servers).
