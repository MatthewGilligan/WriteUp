This is the start of my week 7 file

# Week 7
## Matthew Gilligan

## Recap
Learned SQL injection

## Overview
We needed to access a database in a website through SQL injection. Union select was a big part of it

## Challenge of the week
There was a website. We entered various prompts in order to find the 3 flags

## Reflection 
This was a really fun week. Even the AI wouldn't help me learn SQL injection, so it was really cool that I got to learn the basics. I will make sure to be ethical about this new skill and not hack into stuff (not that I could even if I wanted to)
