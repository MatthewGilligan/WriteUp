# Week 2 Winter term
## Matthew Gilligan

## Notes for the week
This week was all about Stack. We looked at "The" stack and stack overflow, and how you can use it to assess and exploit vulnerabilities. I have yet to take data structures and algorithms, but this wasn't my first exposure to the stack. I programmed in Java during high school, so I had a very rudimentary understanding going into this week. I had been given stack overflow errors many times when I was doing my java coding, so I was very excited to finally use the stack to benefit me this time. To start, we went over what a stack really was.

#### An introduction to stacks
Stacks are a simple data structure that can push a value to an end or pop a value off of an end. Stacks utilize LIFO, or last in first out. It is somewhat like a pile of pancakes, where you put a pancake on the top and can immediately take it off. Stacks can only pop or push from the head, which is the top value. A value can either be moved down, or moved out. You need to pop all values above a value in order to pop it s well. Similar to the pancake analogy, you could imagine it like a scratch space where you can put numbers for later use.
Why would we use stacks? 
We should look at the very basic program 3 4 + which is a program that adds to the stack. First it will push 3, then push 4, then read the plus sign and add them. The takeaway here is that all programs manipulate the stack, and that it is extremely important for keeping track of things, especially when things get more complex. Typically, when things require more complexity, we write functions that can be re-used and called at different times. Everyone reading this knows what a function is, but I definitely didn't know how they actually worked in assembly before this week.
